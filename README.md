# Work In Progress

Converting Spectacles Interaction Kit in Lens Studio to be vanilla Javascript. Typescript is just not fun for me in the context of Lens Studio.

## USING LS 5.3.0

Do not touch the original Spectacles Interaction Kit Folder. Only edit the JS one. Anything under the js folder that's still using typescript is waiting for conversion.

Folder to work in is Assets/SpectaclesInteractionKit JS.

The project in LS will likely not run until most if not all of it is converted as it relies a lot on imports.

Typescript is added in node and can be used to compile files one at time, but it doesn't always work. Don't run it on the whole thing.
